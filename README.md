# JanusKernels

This repository contains implementations of various compute kernels written in CUDA and Triton.

The main goal is for educational purposes and to benchmark the performance of different optimization strategies.



PS: The name “JanusKernels” comes from Janus, the two-faced Roman god, symbolizing the duality of CUDA and Triton :)
